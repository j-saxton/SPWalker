This automation uses MS Graph to enumerate all of the SharePoint lists in the tenant. This automation does not use any premium features. The person running this automation does need read access to the MS Graph APIs to get the list of SharePoint sites. This would typically be the Office 365 Admin. 

The automation will write details about each column to an Excel Spreadsheet. The details include: 
Site Name
